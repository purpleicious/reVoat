# reVoat
An extension for Voat to (hopefully) improve your experience

I noticed a lot of requests for "blah blah **hide something** blah blah", so I made an extension to do just that. It adds an option to "hide" a post, or unhide all hidden posts. It's a work in progress, I'm open to suggestion, and I haven't published it to the chrome store yet, because of the $5 registration fee.
